# 🌱 Solo MVP
## A Code Chrysalis Schedule App

This is app was designed and developed for students at Code Chrysalis hustling away at their immersive course.

It has a dynamic daily schedule that will keep you on track with reminders! So no more late classes.



###### This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

## 🌏 App Navigation
These are the routes that the user has access too:

🥚 **Dashboard** - This is where the eggs will arrive and hatch into cats.

🐱 **Collection** - This is where the user can view their current collection.

🚀 **Schedule** - This is where the user can check their daily schedule.




## 🚀 Project setup
Before anything, let's install all the dependencies I used for this project!
```
yarn install
```
Then compile and minify for local deployment.
```
yarn build
```
Now it's ready to be deployed locally!
```
yarn server
```
