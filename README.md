# 😸 CATch Them All
### A schedule app with a sprinkle of cats!

###### This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

This app was designed and developed specifically for students at Code Chrysalis hustling away at their immersive course.

**CATch Them All** has a dynamic daily scheduler that will keep you on track with reminders, so no more late classes! You'll be looking forward to every day, because a unique cat will hatch at the end of each day to celebrate your progress 🎉 At completion of the immersive course, not only will you have become a competent fullstack engineer, but *more importantly, you will have collected all 60 cats!*



**Check out the app [here!](https://cc12-solo-mvp.herokuapp.com/)**    *Run on mobile for a better experience!*




## 🌏 App Navigation
These are the routes that the user has access too:

🥚 **Dashboard** - This is where the eggs will arrive and hatch into cats.

🐱 **Collection** - This is where the user can view their current collection.

🚀 **Schedule** - This is where the user can check their daily schedule.




## 🚀 Project setup
Before anything, let's install all the dependencies I used for this project!
```
yarn install
```
Then compile and minify for local deployment.
```
yarn build
```
Now it's ready to be deployed locally!
